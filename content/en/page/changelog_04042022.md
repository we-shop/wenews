Quick Intro
===========

What an incredible few weeks it’s been… and say hello to our first ever changelog post on WeShop.

The engineers at WeShop have been working hard to make the WeShop dream a reality. Much of the features we build our driven by the WeShop community, with our team simply steering the ship, many of you are busy contributing to WeShop in your own way; whether that’s buying a new lamp or sharing your new make-up brush set, it all helps make sure that we’re innovating in the right way.

What’s new
==========

*   Introduced Discover: Browse every supported retailer on WeShop and earn WeShares on any purchases you make directly from their website.
*   Dedicated eBay results: You asked, we listened. We’ve given eBay some breathing room, eBay now has a dedicated place to view all their products.
*   Save your filters: You can now set your preferred retailers, brands & price bracket to your default choice.
*   Home Feed Content: You’ll now start to see important notes (like this!) and promotions from WeShop at the top of your home feed.

As always, we appreciate any feedback you have and don’t be afraid to send us your ideas and feature requests.
