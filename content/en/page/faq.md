**How do I create a new profile?**
As a registered user, you will have an empty profile assigned to you, a blank canvas! It is then up to you to start adding products and customising the content to really make your profile stand out from the rest.

**How do I tag products on my post?**
Start by creating a post by clicking “new post”. You can then tag products by searching for a product in the search bar and add it to that particular post. Once done, you can drag and drop the little WeShop logo onto the item you are tagging.

**What should I do if I have forgotten my password?**
Don't worry. Simply follow the password reset instructions when logging in and we'll send you a confirmation email. If you do not seem to receive it, do check your spam or junk folder as it may have landed there. You can also change your password at any time in your "Settings" page.

**Why has my Profile been suspended?**
It could be due to a breach of our Account Owner Agreement  or if you failed to follow our Community Guidelines.If you think there might be an error, please contact us through our help centre or live chat.
