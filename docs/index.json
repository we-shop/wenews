[{"content":" Missing a purchase from your dashboard? Contact customer support to raise a claim\n Become an expert in earning WeShares WeShop has built a powerful platform that connects directly with retailers, making sure every purchase you make appears in your dashboard. WeShop is working with retailers around the clock to try and make sure your purchase appears and if you follow the 10 golden rules you can help your purchases appear every time.\nShareback Do’s  Make your purchase as soon as you tap “Buy now” or visit the retailer from Discover. Your purchase must always be genuine and only ever online, including click and collect orders. Be patient with your WeShares, it can take up to 72 hours to appear in your dashboard. Always pay for your product using a supported debit/credit card. Always make your purchase by clicking via WeShop before you spend, adding items to your basket or wishlist may not work later on.  Shareback Don’ts  Don’t expect shareback to be paid on cancelled or returned orders, even partial returns will change the value of your earnings. Don’t make purchases with gift cards, Klarna, finance or other credit agreements (they don\u0026rsquo;t always work!) Never use voucher or discount codes unless supplied officially from WeShop. If you’re adding multiple items to your basket, remember, not all items will be eligible for WeShares. Don’t add too many high-value items to your basket (e.g., 50 pairs of Apple Airpods) as the retailer will likely suspect fraudulent activity.
